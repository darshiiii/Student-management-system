# Student Management System
## File1: Add a student
This Python script is designed to manage student information and fee details. Users can add student records and store them in a CSV file (`stu.csv`). The script calculates the installment amount based on the total fees and the number of installments chosen.

## Usage

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Follow the prompts to enter student information such as admission number, name, class, age, caste, father's name, mother's name, phone number, gender, fees, and the number of installments.
3. The script calculates the installment amount and prompts for installment details based on the selected number of installments.
4. The student information is then appended to the CSV file (`stu.csv`).

# File2 : Delete a student

This Python script is designed to manage student information and fee details. Users can add and delete student records, which are stored in a CSV file (`stu.csv`). The script uses the Pandas library for data manipulation.

## Usage

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Choose the desired operation:
   - For adding a new student, use the `add_stu()` function.
   - For deleting a student, use the `del_stu()` function.
3. Follow the prompts to enter the necessary information.
4. The script will update the CSV file accordingly.

# File3 : update a student

This Python script is designed to manage student information and fee details. Users can add, delete, and update student records, which are stored in a CSV file (`stu.csv`). The script uses the Pandas library for data manipulation.

## Usage

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Choose the desired operation:
   - For adding a new student, use the `add_stu()` function.
   - For deleting a student, use the `del_stu()` function.
   - For updating a student's information, use the `update_stu()` function.
3. Follow the prompts to enter the necessary information.
4. The script will update the CSV file accordingly.

# THE MAIN FILE

This Python script is designed to manage student information and fee details. Users can add, delete, and update student records, which are stored in a CSV file (`stu.csv`). The script uses separate modules for each operation (`add_student`, `remove_student`, `update_student`).

## Usage

1. Run the main script in a Python environment.
2. Choose the desired operation:
   - For adding a new student, select option 1.
   - For deleting a student, select option 2.
   - For updating a student's information, select option 3.
   - To exit the program, select option 4.
